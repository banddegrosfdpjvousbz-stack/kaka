This is a Discord bot that implements the classic Connect 4 (Puissance 4) game directly within Discord servers. The bot allows Discord users to play interactive Connect 4 matches against each other using slash commands and button interactions. Players take turns dropping colored pieces into a 7-column, 6-row grid with the goal of connecting four pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
